		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning in 1971, the James Bay I and II hydro projects have flooded much of the traditional territory held by the James Bay Cree people and changed their community forever. At the time, the hydro project was the largest in North American history and developed without environmental impact assessment studies or any other requirements which would be required today.</p>
		 <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
		 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The James Bay Cree community was monetarily compensated for their displacement and provided with advantages such as modern houses and a hospital. However, the displacement from their traditional land base soon led to bigger problems, such as alcoholism and mercury poisoning. The damming of rivers had flooded the land and caused vast forest tracts to biodegrade, which released high levels of mercury in ecosystems. The mercury accumulated in the water and through the food chain, including in the fish which are the traditional sustenance of the James Bay Cree community. Between 1982 and 1987, mercury levels doubled among the James Bay Cree community and symptoms such as birth defects, damage to brain functions and nervous systems, kidney damage and DNA alteration manifested itself among the people. Given the chronic nature of mercury poisoning, the full extent of the James Bay mercury poisoning is not yet known.</p>

	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite protest from the community, Hydro Quebec began the James Bay II project in the 1990s. At this time, Quebec was producing a surplus of power and exporting it. In conjunction with environmental protection groups, the James Bay Cree protested in New York, who was slated to have a contract with Hydro Quebec to purchase the surplus energy. Due to mounting domestic and international pressure, Hydro Quebec opted out of the James Bay II project and began exploring more environmentally-friendly ways of producing hydro power. The women from the community were particularly active in the protest against James Bay II, and more information can be found in Suzanne Hawkers’ study entitled, “Unheard Voices of the James May II and the women of Kuujjuarapik.”</p>
