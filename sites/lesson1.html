      <h3>Port Radium, Northwest Territories</h3>

         <h3>Historical Context</h3> 
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>When Port Radium Mines originally opened in 1932, Radium was the most expensive material in the world, costing upwards of $125,000 per gram. By 1940, the lethal effects of radium became known, and the industry collapsed, leading to the closure of the radium mines in Port Radium. Only two short years later, the Canadian government expropriated the mines, creating "Eldorado Nuclear" in 1942. The goal of the reopened mines was to supply uranium for the American nuclear weapon research project. The image on the left shows a miner pushing a cart bearing uranium ore through the Eldorado Mines, sometime in the 1930's.</p>

		 <h3>Port Radium</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         	 	 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastianmol7/daea/gh-pages/images/Port%20Radium.jpg" style="float:right; padding-left:35px">
         <p>After years of mining radioactive material, the Port Radium Mines were decomissioned in 1982. The site was left with silver, copper, uranium, and other radioactive wastes present in soils and surface water. Port Radium was issued remediation by the Canadian Government in order to make the site safer for animals, people, and the environment. The image to the right shows the many factories among the small mining community </p>

		 <h3>Wartime Nuclear Activity</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>After being expropriated by the Canadian Government in 1942, the Eldorado Mines produced and sold uranium salts to the United States for use in their nuclear weapons research. As the uranium was being produced to develop the world's first atomic bombs, the miners and families of those who worked at the mines were sworn to secrecy, and the productions of uranium remained a secret throughout the war. Eldorado Nuclear was one of three uranium mines under Allied control during the Second World War, and as such, Port Radium played a very critical role in the creation of the Atomic Bomb.</p>
