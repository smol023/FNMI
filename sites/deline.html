		 <h3>Historical Context</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>Deline, a small First Nations village found in Northwest Territories, had very little to do with nuclear research or development. The town was an outpost for the transport of uranium ore from the Eldorado Mines in Port Radium to the Eldorado Refinery in Port Hope. The First Nations men of Deline were hired to carry uranium from the mines to the boats on Great Bear Lake, and from there to Fort McMurray, where the Ore would be shipped to Port Hope. The bags of ore would be handled several times throughout their trip, and the workers would often sleep on or near them.</p>		

		 <h3>The Village of Widows</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>After having handled bags of uranium throughout long journeys, many of the First Nations men of Deline began to die of an unknown disease. Having never been exposed to cancer before, the people of Deline did not know what was causing so many deaths. The village became known as the "Village of Widows" due to the high amount of men that died of cancer as a result of transporting the uranium ore. The result was that many children of Deline grew up without fathers, or even grandfathers.</p>

         <h3>Wartime Nuclear Involvement</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>As stated above, Deline's wartime nuclear involvement was limited to the transportation of uranium ore from Port Radium to Port Hope. Unfortunately, their limited nuclear involvement has had long-lasting consequences. The first nations people of the Village of Widows continue to feeling the effects of the radiation poisoning, with many people left without fathers or grandfathers.</p>
