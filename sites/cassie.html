            <h1>Voices of Aboriginal Youth in Canada:</h1>
      <h3>Cassie (from a Mi’kmaQ community in Nova Scotia)</h3>
          <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
         <h3>Cassie's Interview:</h3> 
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Cassie is 16 year-old girl who is part of the Mi’kMaq community in Nova Scotia. In addition to going to being a high school student, Cassie is taking driver’s education classes, plays hockey, and has a part-time tutoring job. On weekends, she watches movies with her friends, goes on the Internet, goes for walks in the neighbourhood and in the woods, spends time at her stepsister’s house, and babysits for her godmother. Cassie wants to go to college, spend some time exploring the world, and become a counsellor that talks to people, especially kids. In all, she believes that she is a pretty normal person.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassie lives with dad, her stepmother, her sister, and two of her stepmother’s children, but remains close with her stepmother’s older daughter (Cassie’s stepsister), and her grandparents. The most important people in her life include her father, her stepsister, her godmother, and a girl that she baby-sits – these people are a good role model for her and helps to keep her grounded. Cassie’s mother passed away when she was six years old. Cassie has a strong relationship with her family and her community and notes that unlike non-Aboriginal communities where people tend to keep to themselves, the whole Aboriginal community is generally spiritually connected with each other and supportive of each other, especially in times of hardship. This means a lot to Cassie.</p> 
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassie tries to keep in touch with her Mi’kMaw culture by learning more about the Mi’kmaq language (she does not speak the language) and by going to workshops to learn more about her culture. For example, she attended a workshop last summer where she learned about the medicine circle and herbal medicines, and built sweat lodges. Though communal events in her community, such as baseball tournaments and pow-wows, are have become infrequent over the years, she still visits other reserves to meet new people, play bingo, participate in blueberry harvests, and attend pow-wows.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Land plays a big role in Mi’kmaq culture, and Cassie thinks about how the decisions she makes today will influence future generations. She believes that people need to start speaking up and changing the bad things. She wants to take away all the drugs and alcohol away and gets mad when kids destroy communal property and things that everybody uses.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She believes that things would be better if her community was self-governing, because the Canadian government does not understand what the Aboriginal community needs, has treated the Aboriginal poorly in the past, and continues to treat them differently. Cassie notices that there are tensions when she enters spaces of non-White people and non-Aboriginal people assume that her people are rowdy and only out to make trouble. She also notes that there is an unfair characterization of Indigenous people, where the bad actions of an Aboriginal individual reflect poorly on the whole Aboriginal community, but the bad action of a non-Aboriginal person reflects only on that person and not their community. She also knows that there are tensions with non-Aboriginal communities over hunting and fishing treaty rights. She believes that this tension is rooted in a lack of knowledge about Aboriginal individuals and culture, and non-Aboriginal people need to be exposed to who Aboriginal people are as individuals and as a community. She feels that her community is excluded and put away in a corner, where everyone knows they exist but people are too scared to come see for themselves.</p>
