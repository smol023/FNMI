		 <h3>Historical Context</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>Eldorado Refinery was a state-of-the-art refinery originally built in 1932 in Port Hope, Ontario. The Eldorado Refinery extracted radium from uranium ore, dumping the uranium waste throughout Port Hope or using it as fill material. The refinery stayed open for about eight years, using the small town as a dump site for tonnes of uranium waste.</p>
         <p>The newspaper article on the right was found in a 1933 "Port Hope Weekly Guide" newspaper. The article informs the people of Port Hope that work at Eldorado would continue and that Eldorado would likely expand its workload within the next year.</p>
         <p>The Eldorado Refinery in Port Hope was replaced by Cameco, a Uranium conversion plant, in 1988. Port Hope's uranium conversion facility is one of four Uranium conversion plants in the Western World.</p>

		 <h3>Port Hope</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Port Hope is a small residential town with a population of roughly 16,000 located in Southern Ontario. Due to Port Hope's history of participation in Nuclear Research, particularly in refining of radioactive materials, the small town has the highest amount of low-level radioactive waste in Canada. Because of this, many in Port Hope question why the small town continues to have vested interest through their investment in Cameco's uranium conversion facility.</p>
		 <p>The image to the left shows the once beautiful Port Hope harbour, with the now lost West Beach next to the Eldorado Nuclear Facility. The caption of the photo reads "The West Beach and the baseball diamond were popular spots for many years, for young and old. But no longer. Cameco now occupies almost the entire area, effectively cutting the town off from the lake. Streets that once ran on this side of the viaducts, and the houses that were built on them, have disappeared. The ball diamond and the Pavilion are long gone, the beach has been left a wasteland where people go to walk their dogs. The former West Beach is no more, and the tiny East Beach is there to remind us of the magnitude of our loss." The loss of West Beach is only a small fraction of what has been lost to Port Hope's Nuclear Facility.</p>
         <br>
         <h3>Wartime Nuclear Research</h3>
         <p>After having been closed in 1940, the Eldorado Refinery, along with the Eldorado Mines in Port Radium, were expropriated by the Canadian Government in 1942, renaming the facilities "Eldorado Nuclear". Eldorado Nuclear began supplying the United States with Uranium as part of the wartime effort to develop the first atomic bombs. This effort became known as the Manhattan Project.</p>
         <p>After several years of dumping uranium waste throughout Port Hope, the uses for uranium in nuclear weapons became better understood. In an effort to create the first nuclear weapon, the uranium waste that was dumped throughout Port Hope was recovered and sent to the United States in their effort to develop the first atomic bombs. The irony of this is that Port Hope's first radioactive waste cleanup supplied the uranium that would be used to develop the first atomic bomb, killing more than 140,000 people.</p>
