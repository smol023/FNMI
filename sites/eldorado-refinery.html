		 <h3>Historical Context</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>Eldorado Refinery was a state-of-the-art refinery originally built in 1933 in Port Hope, Ontario, to refine radium. Less than 10 years later, when the uses for Uranium were better understood, the Eldorado Refinery began supplying the United States with uranium.</p>
         <p>The newspaper article on the right was found in a 1933 "Port Hope Weekly Guide" newspaper. The article informs the people of Port Hope that work at Eldorado would continue and that Eldorado would likely expand its workload within the next year.</p>
         <p>The Eldorado Refinery in Port Hope was replaced by Cameco, a Uranium conversion plant, in 1988. Port Hope's uranium conversion facility is one of four Uranium conversion plants in the Western World.</p>

		 <h3>Port Hope</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Port Hope is a small residential town with a population of roughly 16,000 located in Southern Ontario. Due to Port Hope's history of participation in Nuclear Research, particularly in refining of radioactive materials, the small town has the highest amount of low-level radioactive waste in Canada. Because of this, many in Port Hope question why the small town continues to have vested interest through their investment in Cameco's uranium conversion facility.</p>
		 <p>The image to the left shows the once beautiful Port Hope harbour, with the now lost West Beach in the top right corner. The caption of the photo reads "The once-beautiful, and irreplaceable, West Beach with the Pavilion and Gazebo, and the Softball Diamond, are visible in the upper right corner of this picture. Because of Eldorado/Cameco, they're gone. Cameco is still here. Why?"</p>
         <br>
         <h3>Nuclear Research</h3>
         <p>After having been closed in 1940, the Eldorado Refinery, along with the Eldorado Mines in Port Radium, were expropriated by the Canadian Government in 1942, renaming the facilities "Eldorado Nuclear". Eldorado Nuclear began supplying the United States with Uranium as part of the wartime effort to develop the first atomic bombs.</p>
