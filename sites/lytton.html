        <h1>Finding a solution to Canada’s Indigenous water crisis</h1>
	     <h3>Lack of Access to Water</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access to safe drinking water on Indigenous reserves has been a long-standing problem in Canada. Canada’s federalist structure and division of jurisdictional creates a two-tiered system that result in Indigenous communities facing a “troubling” situation resembling a “third-world country”. More specifically, the federal government does not have the same enforceable norms regarding water quality regulations and does not provide the same access, level, and regularity of funding as the provincial governments. Furthermore, Indigenous reserves also tend to be more isolated, which is an adds an additional layer of infrastructural challenges.</p>
		 <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
		 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are currently 75 long-term drinking water advisories affecting more than 50 Indigenous communities. In 2016, the Trudeau government made a commitment to end all long-term water advisory and the Minister of Indigenous Services Canada (INS), Jane Philpott, states that Canada is “firmly on track” to meet the target. However, such statements must be taken in consideration of previous broken commitments to end water advisories, the challenges of implementation as highlighted by civil society, and the scattering of new water advisories that have been called since 2016.</p>

	     <h3>Lytton, British Columbia</h3>
	   <br>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rural community of 945 people located in British Columbia, Lytton is located at the confluence of two waterways. However, upstream contamination resulting from animal faeces and agricultural activity renders the water unsafe to drink. When the community made a C$1.3m proposal to upgrade their aging water facility to service six houses, it was rejected by INS for not being “cost effective.” </p>
	     <br>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, the community turned to RES’EAU-WaterNet, a network at University of British Columbia researching innovative manners to provide safe drinking water on a smaller scale. In 2015/2016, RES’EAU designed a smaller and lower maintenance system for C$500,000 and provided Point-of-Entry (PoE) systems for Lytton’s more isolated houses. However, there are still several other houses in Lytton who do not have clean water because their do not have the infrastructure or conditions to support either of these two systems.</p>
	     <br>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To maintain their water systems, Lytton has begun looking for long-term solutions beyond government promises. For example, Warren Brown, a water operator, actively reaches out to engage the next generation into waterworks.</p>

	     <h3>Grassy Narrows, Ontario</h3>
	     <br>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the mercury poisoning incident the 1960s and 70s, Grassy Narrows has been under a “Do not consume” advisory since 2013.</p>
	     <hr>
	     <h3>Shoal Lake, Manitoba</h3>
	     <br>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early 1990s, the First Nations community has been under an advisory as their waterways were diverted towards provide water to Winnipeg. Since then, the community of 71 residents have spent an annual C$100,000 to import bottled water.</p>
