Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories' <i>Zero Energy Experimental Pile Reactor</i> was the first Nuclear Reactor  in the World outside of the United States to become operational.",<a href="sites/chalk-river-labs.html">MORE DETAILS</a>    
66.085167,-118.036,<h5>Port Radium:</h5>,<h4>Eldorado Mines</h4>,"Ominously named, Port Radium Mines opened up in 1932 in The Northwest Territories. At the time, Radium was the most expensive material on Earth, but as health concerns proved that the material was lethal, the price of Radium dropped, and the mines were closed in 1940. After being expropriated by the Canadian Government, Radium Mines, now known as Eldorado Mines, were reopened in 1942 to provide Uranium to the American Nuclear Weapons Program.",<a href="sites/eldorado-mines.html">MORE DETAILS</a>

Much of Montréal Labratory's Nuclear research was directed towards the Manhatten Project, as the Americans began researching and developing the first atomic weapons.",<a href="sites/montreal-laboratory.html">MORE DETAILS</a>
49.095,-117.71,<h5>Trail:</h5>,<h4>Cominco</h4>,"With Nuclear reactors relying on the supply of what is known as heavy water, an enriched water mixture that mostly consists of deuterium oxide, the production of heavy water was vital to the success of Nuclear Reactors. Cominco, an American owned company located in Trail, Britich Columbia, produced and supplied Heavy Water to Montréal Laboratory, as well as many other Nuclear Research Facilities, such as the Chicago Pile 3, the World's first Heavy Water Nuclear Reactor. Cominco's role in Canada's Atomic History is little more than providing Heavy Water to Canada, and as such, will not need further details.",

The men of the village would transport bags of uranium from the mines to Fort McMurray, where the uranium would be transported to the Eldorado refinery in Port Hope. Deline became known as the Village of Widows as many of the men began to die of cancer while handling uranium.",<a href="sites/deline.html">MORE DETAILS</a>
46.383333,-82.65,<h5>Elliot Lake:</h5>,<h4>Elliot Lake Uranium Mines</h4>,"Located between Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie, the city of Elliot Lake opened 12 uranium mines in a continued effort to research nuclear weapons. The waste from the mines were dumped into ten of the surrounding lakes, contaminating the ten lakes, as well as 90km of the Serpent River.",<a href="sites/elliot-lake.html">MORE DETAILS</a>
