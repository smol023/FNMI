At the time, Radium was the most expensive material on Earth, but as health concerns proved that the material was lethal, the price of Radium dropped, and the mines were closed in 1940. After being expropriated by the Canadian Government, Radium Mines, now known as Eldorado Mines, were reopened in 1942 to provide Uranium to the American Nuclear Weapons Program.",<a href="sites/eldorado-mines.html">MORE DETAILS</a>

Cominco, an American owned company located in Trail, Britich Columbia, produced and supplied Heavy Water to Montréal Laboratory, as well as many other Nuclear Research Facilities, such as the Chicago Pile 3, the World's first Heavy Water Nuclear Reactor. Cominco's role in Canada's Atomic History is little more than providing Heavy Water to Canada, and as such, will not need further details.",
