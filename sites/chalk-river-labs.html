         <p>With the slow proceedings of the Montreal Laboratory, Canada, alongside Britian and the United States agreed to work closely together to progress nuclear weapons research. The construction of the Zero Energy Experimental Pile (ZEEP) began in August of 1944, and reached critical on September 5th of 1945. The ZEEP of Chalk River Laboratories became the world's first nuclear reactor to reach critical outside of the United States of America. The image to the right shows a group photo taken of many of the people involved in the construction of Chalk River Laboratories.</p>		
		 <h3>Deep River</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>In further collaboration between British and Canadian nuclear researchers, the Chalk River Laboratories were established by the National Research Council of Canada in 1944 as the predecessor of the Montreal Laboratory. Built in the small community of Deep River, roughly 180km northwest of Ottawa, the much less residential area provided a higher measure of secrecy than the previously established Montreal Laboratory, as well as allowed for less concerns for public health and safety. Upon establishing the ZEEP reactor, Chalk River Laboratories continued to establish several more reactors, such as the NRX and NRU reactors. As seen in the image below, the Chalk River Laboratories quickly established several reactors. This image was taken in 1954.</p>

         <h3>Wartime Nuclear Research</h3>
         <p>The world's first atomic bombs were dropped in August of 1945 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. Shortly after, in September of 1945, Chalk River Laboratories' ZEEP reactor became the first nuclear reactor outside of the United States to reach critical. In 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was completely shut down, and nuclear research efforts were directed toward Chalk River Laboratories.
