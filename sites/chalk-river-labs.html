         <p>With the slow proceedings of the Montreal Laboratory, Canada, alongside Britian and the United States agreed to work closely together to progress nuclear weapons research. The construction of the Zero Energy Experimental Pile (ZEEP) began in August of 1944, and reached critical on September 5th of 1945. The ZEEP of Chalk River Laboratories became the world's first nuclear reactor to reach critical outside of the United States of America.</p>		
		 <h3>Deep River</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>In further collaboration between British and Canadian nuclear researchers, the Chalk River Laboratories were established by the National Research Council of Canada in 1944 as the predecessor of the Montreal Laboratory. Built in the small community of Deep River, roughly 180km northwest of Ottawa, the much less residential area provided a higher measure of secrecy than the previously established Montreal Laboratory, as well as allowed for less concerns for public health and safety. Upon establishing the ZEEP reactor, Chalk River Laboratories continued to establish several more reactors, such as the NRX and NRU reactors. As seen in the image to the left, the Chalk River Laboratories quickly established several reactors. This image was taken in 1954.</p>

         <h3>Research</h3>
         <p><b>Fishermen's Hall</b></p>
         <p>The preservation of the Fishermen's hall is extraordinary, given its historical context, and in 1985 it received the Southcott Award for Building Restoration/Preservation, given by the Newfoundland and Labrador Historic Trust.</p>
         <p>The Fishermen's Hall was originally built as an exhibition hall for fisheries and agricultural produce. It also became a popular location for other social events, including dances, lectures, and theatre, and was even used as a Catholic place of worship and as the Sisters of Mercy Catholic school.</p>
         <br>
         <p><b>Professor Danielle</b></p>
         <p>Charles Henry Danielle, known as 'Professor Danielle' was a colourful and eccentric character about whom little is known prior to his arrival in St. John's in 1860.  Born November 1st, 1830 in Baltimore, Maryland, Danielle was a self-advertised 'professor' of the Tarsichorean art and the owner of a successful Chicago dance academy.</p>
         		          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastianmol7/daea/gh-pages/images/newdanielle.png" style="float:right; padding-left:35px">
         		          <p>After arriving in St. John's, he advertised himself as a dance instructor and costume-maker, and quickly developed a reputation of glamour and mystery. He leased the downtown building known as the Victorian Skating Rink, and from there hosted fancy-dress balls and parties, and elaborate carnivals and theatrical productions which show-cased his costumes.  Danielle left St. John's rather suddenly in 1865, following a fire (purportedly started by an enemy) which destroyed the property, including his collection of costumes, which he insured for thousands of dollars.</p>
         		          <p>Danille returned to St. John's on May 30th, 1888, and once again commenced to host his popular carnival and parties. He also ran a successful restaurant on Water Street which was destroyed in the fire of 1892. He died on May 1st, 1902, in the 'Octagon Castle' (his elaborate, eight-side home near Irvine, Newfoundland), and was buried in the Anglican cemetary on the shores of Quidi Vidi Lake, a small body of water (visible on the map) located to the South-West of St. John's.</p>
         <p><b>T.M. Brown</b></p>
         <p>Nothing further could be found on T.M. Brown. While Brown appears to have been a relatively common name in the area, no records fitting the combination of initials and last name of this man could be located.</p>
