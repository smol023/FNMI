      <h1>FNMI Resource Guide: An Interactive Map</h1>
	  <h4>Samantha Andrews, Samuel Boisvert, Sara Darvish, Sebastian Mol</h4>
         <h3>Resource Guide Overview</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		<p>We have decided to make an interactive map for our resource guide, as we believe it allows us to create engaging lessons that pull the students in and give them a better understanding some of the issues that Indigenous people face within Canada. As we have only engaged in two lessons for this resource guide, our map reflects a very tiny portion of the wide-scope of issues that Indigenous people face within Canada.</p>
		<p>We have decided to focus our Resource Guide on the relationship Indigenous communities within Canada share with water. In our first lesson, we look at the impacts of pollution on the environment, and specifically the impact that pollution has on water. Our second lesson focuses on the lack of potable water within Canada’s Indigenous communities, as well as the implications of the lack of intervention from the Canadian Government.</p>
		 <h3>Why we chose to focus on water</h3>
		 <p>We chose to focus on the relationship that Indigenous communities share with water, as we believe that it is very important to understand this relationship, as well as the implications that pollution and lack of government intervention has on these communities.</p>
		 <h3>Connection to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada: Calls to Action</h3>
		<h5>**3. We call upon all levels of government to fully implement Jordan’s Principle.**</h5>
	     	<p>Jordan’s Principle is a child first, needs-based principle that is supposed to ensure that First Nations children have equitable access to all government funded services. When it comes to providing access to potable water, the jurisdictional responsibilities are often disputed. Who’s responsible for providing access to clean and safe water to First Nation communities? Federal? Provincial? Territorial? Municipal? Regardless of who is responsible, the result often ends with an unfulfilled promise of providing First Nations children with equitable access to government funded services (Sheppard).</p>
	     	<h5>**18. We call upon the federal, provincial, territorial, and Aboriginal governments to acknowledge that the current state of Aboriginal health in Canada is a direct result of previous Canadian government policies, including residential schools, and to recognize and implement the health-care rights of Aboriginal people as identified in international law, constitutional law, and under the Treaties.**</h5>
	        <p>Section 18 calls upon the Canadian Government to “recognize and implement health-care rights of Aboriginal people as identified in international law, constitutional law, and under the Treaties". According to a report done by the David Suzuki Foundation, “Access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation is a human right, one that the government is obligated to uphold through international law.”(David Suzuki Foundation).</p>
	        <h5>**19. We call upon the federal government, in consultation with Aboriginal peoples, to establish measurable goals to identify and close the gaps in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities, and to publish annual progress reports and assess long term trends. Such efforts would focus on indicators such as: infant mortality, maternal health, suicide, mental health, addictions, life expectancy, birth rates, infant and child health issues, chronic diseases, illness and injury incidence, and the availability of appropriate health services.**</h5>
	        <p>Section 19 Calls upon the federal government to close the gaps in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. Although water advisories may help prevent severe public health concerns in First Nations communities, the reality of the situation is that oftentimes people do not have the time or resources to treat their tap water before using it. With contaminants such as E. coli, Trihalomethanes, and Uranium, the water in many First Nation communities isn’t safe to use for any menial household tasks, let alone bathing or drinking (Human Rights Watch). If the government wants to close the gaps in health outcomes, they need to address the severe health concerns that are a result of the unsafe water within First Nations communities.</p>
