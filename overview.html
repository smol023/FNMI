      <h1>FNMI Resource Guide: An Interactive Map:</h1>

         <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example--> 
	     <h3><b>Resource Guide Overview:</b></h3>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have decided to make an interactive map for our resource guide, as we believe it allows us to create engaging lessons that pull the students in and give them a better understanding some of the issues that Indigenous people face within Canada. As we have only engaged in two lessons for this resource guide, our map reflects a very tiny portion of the wide-scope of issues that Indigenous people face within Canada.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have decided to focus our Resource Guide on the relationship Indigenous communities within Canada share with water. In our first lesson, we look at the impacts of pollution on the environment, and specifically the impact that pollution has on water. Our second lesson focuses on the lack of potable water within Canada’s Indigenous communities, as well as the implications of the lack of intervention from the Canadian Government.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over twenty-four First Nations across Canada still have to endure consistent water-boiling advisories, and having to live without access to clean water for long periods of time – sometimes decades even – is a shocking reality. We chose to explore this issue by forming a cross-disciplinary approach to create an interactive resource guide that draws from learning goals in both Geography and English.</p>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In creating this resource, we were inspired by floor maps and synthetic maps that were created by Canadian Geographic, which explore the various histories and contributions of Indigenous civilizations, as well as the legacy of residential schools. These maps help us to understand that over time, social and political factors have led to changes in geographical borders between settler-land and the traditional territories of Indigenous peoples. In this spirit, we have decided to create a virtual map that will enable our students to engage with the issue of clean-water-access through the use of technology and lesson plans that support student investigation and critical thinking towards a better understanding of the issues faced by Indigenous people across Canada today. Because our lesson plans rely on concepts from the study of human geography to explore layers to this issue, cross-disciplinary links between English and Geography became well-established throughout the design process.</p>

		     <h3><b>Why we chose to focus on water:</b></h3>
		 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We chose to focus on the relationship that Indigenous communities share with water, as we believe that it is very important to understand this relationship, as well as the implications that pollution and lack of government intervention has on these communities.</p>
		   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing information about access to clean water should become a fundamental learning goal for all students in Canada, and teachers should feel secure in their ability to draw on complete and sophisticated resources that help raise awareness on this issue. Our hope is for teachers to feel comfortable in adapting our lesson plans to the diverse needs of their classrooms, leading to rich learning experience for students that will lead to further opportunities for them to become advocates for change.</p>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to discussing the issues faced by Indigenous people across Canada, we know that clean water is fundamental, but it’s only part of a larger conversation. Since our group has chosen to focus on developing two lesson plans for this particular resource guide, the design of our virtual map is limited to the issues being explored within those lessons. In both lesson plans, students are invited to perform research on other issues faced by Indigenous people, and encouraged to establish links between their findings to lessons on clean water.</p>

	     <h3><b>Connection to Ontario Curriculum:</b></h3>
	      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We chose to focus our resource guide on lesson plans for English and geography because we believe that it’s important to incorporate Native culture and history into all subjects, instead of just social studies. English was an easy subject for us to work Indigenous issues into because it’s simple to add stories written by Indigenous authors into the curriculum while facilitating discussions and reflection about those same issues. The first reading we incorporated is an excerpt from “Voices of Aboriginal Youth in Canada”. It’s an interview with a Mi’kmaq teenager about what she thinks of her community. We decided to incorporate it and relate it to the “Reading for Meaning” section of the Ontario curriculum. They need to read the interview, select what they think is important, and respond to it. We think that using the “Reading for Meaning” section of overall curriculum expectations will help students engage deeply with what they’ve read.</p>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For geography, we focused on the physical environment and human activities section of the curriculum so that we could discuss water-related issues in our resource guide.</p>

	     <h3><b>Connection to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada: Calls to Action:</b></h3>
	        <h4><b>3. We call upon all levels of government to fully implement Jordan’s Principle.</b></h4>
	     	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jordan’s Principle is a child first, needs-based principle that is supposed to ensure that First Nations children have equitable access to all government funded services. When it comes to providing access to potable water, the jurisdictional responsibilities are often disputed. Who’s responsible for providing access to clean and safe water to First Nation communities? Federal? Provincial? Territorial? Municipal? Regardless of who is responsible, the result often ends with an unfulfilled promise of providing First Nations children with equitable access to government funded services (Sheppard).</p>
	      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->	
	     <h4><b>18. We call upon the federal, provincial, territorial, and Aboriginal governments to acknowledge that the current state of Aboriginal health in Canada is a direct result of previous Canadian government policies, including residential schools, and to recognize and implement the health-care rights of Aboriginal people as identified in international law, constitutional law, and under the Treaties.</b></h4>
	        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 18 calls upon the Canadian Government to “recognize and implement health-care rights of Aboriginal people as identified in international law, constitutional law, and under the Treaties". According to a report done by the David Suzuki Foundation, “Access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation is a human right, one that the government is obligated to uphold through international law.”(David Suzuki Foundation).</p>
	      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example--> 
	     <h4><b>19. We call upon the federal government, in consultation with Aboriginal peoples, to establish measurable goals to identify and close the gaps in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities, and to publish annual progress reports and assess long term trends. Such efforts would focus on indicators such as: infant mortality, maternal health, suicide, mental health, addictions, life expectancy, birth rates, infant and child health issues, chronic diseases, illness and injury incidence, and the availability of appropriate health services.</b></h4>
	        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 19 Calls upon the federal government to close the gaps in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. Although water advisories may help prevent severe public health concerns in First Nations communities, the reality of the situation is that oftentimes people do not have the time or resources to treat their tap water before using it. With contaminants such as E. coli, Trihalomethanes, and Uranium, the water in many First Nation communities isn’t safe to use for any menial household tasks, let alone bathing or drinking (Human Rights Watch). If the government wants to close the gaps in health outcomes, they need to address the severe health concerns that are a result of the unsafe water within First Nations communities.</p>
	      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
	     <h4><b>62. We call upon the federal, provincial, and territorial governments, in consultation and collaboration with Survivors, Aboriginal peoples, and educators, to: i. Make age-appropriate curriculum on residential schools, Treaties, and Aboriginal peoples’ historical and contemporary contributions to Canada a mandatory education requirement for Kindergarten to Grade Twelve students.</b></h4>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our resource guide makes an attempt to provide material to teach students about Indigenous communities’ issues involving water, including the lack of provision of drinking water and the pollution of rivers and lakes. We thought that these water issues are important issues that students should be aware of, since they reflect Indigenous people’s connection to their land and ways that the Canadian government has disrespected that and denied Indigenous people the same human rights afforded to non-Native citizens.</p>

	     <h3><b>Nourishing the Learning Spirit: How Our Research Guide Works to Decolonize the Classroom</b></h3> 
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As teacher-candidates of non-indigenous heritage, we believe the effects of pollution on access to clean water for Indigenous communities is an issue of national urgency; as a group, it was very important for us to design a sophisticated, comprehensive resource guide for teachers and students so they could learn more about this issue, but we recognize that non-indigenous bias must be acknowledged as a factor that may hinder efforts to decolonize the classroom.</p>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her article, Marie Battiste points out how statistics on the inequities facing First Nations’ students do little to convey any true urgency or impact of the devastating realities they face in comparison to other students across the country. Our group acknowledges that the reason for this may be due to the fact that broad notions of Canadian identity do not condition the settler population to value Indigenous lives in the same way. Upon reading the article, it becomes clear that Indigenous educators continue to experience the outright dismissal of their perspectives and cultural knowledge as if it were illegitimate or without value, and Battiste’s declares that provincial teachers are responsible for supporting and reaffirming the legitimacy of Indigenous educators by making it a priority to normalize their perspectives in the classroom.</p>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the planning stages of this resource, we took Battiste’s criticisms and directives very seriously. We recognize the fact clean-water is not “an Indigenous issue” as it is often framed – indeed, it is a human rights issue that all Canadians should be concerns about and feel threatened by. We also recognize that taking on the lens of human rights when considering clean-water on First Nations is actually in contrast to the major rhetoric that dominates the way Canadian politicians and urban populations interact with this issue. Thus, incorporating the significance of social justice perspectives into activities that make up our cross-disciplinary unit plan between English and Geography feel justified and make intuitive sense.</p>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to note that students in both the junior and intermediate categories are precocious and useful at seeking out resources by their own volition, but they are not immune to a discourse that historically downplays and omits the realities faced by First Nations and other Indigenous peoples. As non-Indigenous teachers, it is our job to guide all students toward the growing wealth of resources that have been meticulously developed by Indigenous educators over time, and throughout the design of our mini-unit, we focused on alleviating our own biases by relying largely on original content that has been created and curated by Indigenous educators and professionals.</p>
	    <br>
	     <h5><b>Lesson One: Voices of Aboriginal Youth in Canada</b></h5>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning goals for our first lesson plan support classroom discussions on the meaning of equality, equity, and inclusion – concepts that are often articulated across English literature and that are used to study societies and their patterns through the sub-discipline of human geography. Guiding questions are flexible enough to allow class discussion to address students’ understandings of boil-water advisories that affect First Nations, and considerations of how global warming and environmental degradation tends to affect Indigenous communities in disproportionate numbers.</p>
		<br>
	     <h5><b>Lesson Two: Parliamentary Calls to Action</b></h5>
	       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, our second lesson touches on human rights violations that have led to the general mistrust that is carried by Indigenous people towards law enforcement, the justice system, and the federal government as a whole. In the absence of intervention by Canada’s governments, Indigenous communities have taken it upon themselves to gather and pursue their own strategies, advocacy campaigns and proposed solutions. These perspectives will become the focus for helping students understand why different solutions are required for Indigenous communities, and why Canada is responsible for supporting local Indigenous governments in their decisions about what is best for their lands, territories, and communities.</p>
